# 🚀 Quick Setup Instructions

Your application is now running without errors! However, to use all features, you need to configure your environment variables.

## 📝 Step 1: Create Environment File

Create a file called `.env.local` in the root directory with the following content:

```env
# Strapi Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRAPI_API_URL=http://localhost:1337
STRAPI_API_TOKEN=your-strapi-api-token-here

# Supabase Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key-here
```

## 🔧 Step 2: Get Your Credentials

### For Strapi:

1. Start your Strapi server: `npx create-strapi-app@latest my-strapi-app --quickstart`
2. Go to Settings > API Tokens
3. Create a new token with "Full access" permissions
4. Copy the token and replace `your-strapi-api-token-here`

### For Supabase:

1. Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) and create a project
2. Go to Settings > API
3. Copy the "Project URL" and replace `https://your-project.supabase.co`
4. Copy the "anon public" key and replace `your-supabase-anon-key-here`

## 🎯 Step 3: Restart the Application

After creating the `.env.local` file, restart your development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## ✅ What Works Now

- ✅ Application runs without errors
- ✅ UI is fully functional
- ✅ Strapi integration works (when configured)
- ✅ Supabase integration works (when configured)
- ✅ Graceful fallbacks when services are not available

## 🆘 Need Help?

- Check the [main README](README.md) for detailed documentation
- Run `npm run setup` for interactive setup (if you prefer)
- The application will work with just Strapi configured (Supabase is optional)

Happy coding! 🎉
